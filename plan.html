This website should be considerably be simple yet persuasive so that the audience can follow along about the information given on the pages.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>This is a website for a small family-run local business which has been operating in Hulkstown since 2012. Usually, if there is too many information or icons on one page it will definitely confuse the users who visit this website. Due to the fact that most of the visitors of this website range from ages of 35-50, these adults should have access to this site where all the necessary information is laid out clearly and it informs them well if they wish to further explore the website. Also making sure that if people wants to sign up, there will be a tab presented clearly on all pages of the website.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The targeted audience for this webite is usually for people between the age group of 35-50 but a younger audience is definitely welcome as well. Due to that age group and the assumption that they are not tech savvy, it is much more convenient to keep the website as simple as possible with minimal colors and images on one page. Also the usage of bright colors for this website should be avoided presumbably that there may be adults that are sensitive to these bright colors and also avoid any themes that may cause epilepsy.</p>
